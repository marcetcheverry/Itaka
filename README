Itaka requires the following programs/libraries.

- PyGTK 2.10.0 or higher
- GTK 2.10 or higher

2. INSTALLATION:

Itaka needs to be installed as the root user.

Unpack and install the Itaka tarball using these commands:

   'tar -xjvf <packagename>.tar.bz2'

Switch to the newly created directory and type 'make install' as root and the 
Makefile will copy the files to the correct location in your system. You do not 
need to configure or compile Itaka as it is written in interpreted Python code.

To uninstall, once again as root type 'make uninstall'

3. DEBIAN PACKAGE:

To create the Debian package simply do:

    # Make sure you have your gpg keys and debian development environment correctly setup
    debuild

4. DOCUMENTATION:

Itaka uses Epytext Markup Language to comment its code. 

You can download epydoc from http://epydoc.sourceforge.net/

You can generate documentation using epydoc.

    mkdir doc
    epydoc --html -o doc -n Itaka -u "http://itaka.jardinpresente.com.ar" *.py

5. HACKING

If you intend to change Itaka source code, please read the HACKING file.

6. RELEASE NOTES:

See the ChangeLog for more detailed information.

Donations for this software would be greatly appreciated. This software is 
totally free, but sending a few dollars via PayPal would bring you good karma,
and it'll also mean you'll get extra Developer Suck-Up and support.
Plus, it will ensure that I have enough caffeine to develop new 
versions.

Please visit http://itaka.jardinpresente.com.ar to donate.
