1. REQUIRED LIBRARIES:

Itaka requires the following programs/libraries.

- Python 2.3 or higher
- PyGTK 2.10.0 or higher
- GTK 2.10 or higher
- Twisted 2.2.0 or higher

2. INSTALLATION:

Itaka needs to be installed as the root user.

Unpack and install the Itaka tarball using these commands:

   'tar -xjvf <packagename>.tar.bz2'

Switch to the newly created directory and type 'make install' as root and the 
Makefile will copy the files to the correct location in your system. You do not 
need to configure or compile Itaka as it is written in interpreted Python code.

By default itaka will be installed in /usr/local/, if you want to use another location, add PREFIX=/usr/mylocation after every make command, including unnstall.

Example: make PREFIX=/usr

To uninstall, once again as root type 'make uninstall'

3. DEBIAN PACKAGE:

To create the Debian package simply do:

    # Make sure you have your gpg keys and debian development environment correctly setup
    # You must also package the itaka source as a tarball per debian guidelines.

    debuild

4. DOCUMENTATION:

Itaka uses Epytext Markup Language to comment its code. 

You can download epydoc from http://epydoc.sourceforge.net/

You can generate documentation using epydoc.

    mkdir doc
    epydoc --html -o doc -n Itaka -u "http://itaka.jardinpresente.com.ar" *.py

You can also use Doxygen by doing:
    mkdir doc
    doxygen Doxyfile

5. HACKING

If you intend to change Itaka source code, please read the HACKING file.

6. TRANSLATIONS:

Translating Itaka to another language is quite easy, you first need GNU gettext installed. 

Each stable Itaka version will ship with a .pot template file located in
locale/itaka.pot. This template includes all the code strings, it's the base you should use to create your translation.

If you've changed any strings in in the code, the itaka.pot file can be regenerated by doing:
    $ xgettext -oj locale/itaka.pot *.py
    # If you find duplicates, do:
    $ msguniq -o locale/itaka.pot locale/itaka.pot

The last command cleans up duplicate entries, which saves you a lot of time and avoids errors.

If you want to create a brand new translation, and have not modified code, do the following:

    $ mkdir -p locale/de/LC_MESSAGES/
    $ LANG=de_DE msginit -o locale/de/LC_MESSAGES/itaka.po
    $ msgmerge -U locale/de/LC_MESSAGES/itaka.po locale/itaka.pot

Of course relace 'de_DE' for the language you are using.

Now edit the itaka.po file. When you are done translating the strings, submit
the .po file to the bug tracker (see BUGS file) as an enhancement. If you want
to start using the translation right away, you need to create a binary by doing
the following:

    $ msgfmt locale/de/LC_MESSAGES/de.po -o locale/de/LC_MESSAGES/de.mo
    $ LANG=de_DE itaka

If you want to update existings translations, follow the steps to regenerate
the .pot template if code was changed, then do the following to merge the new changes with your translation file:

    $ msgmerge -U locale/lang/LC_MESSAGES/language.po locale/itaka.pot

For more information, please see the GNU gettext manual at http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/gettext.html

NOTE: Your system must have the locale you want to work with installed prior to working with Itaka, if not you might get this message from Python "locale.Error: unsupported locale setting". Refer to your system documentations on how to install/set locales/languages.
